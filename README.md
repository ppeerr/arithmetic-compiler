# arithmetic-compiler

Need to make a simple compiler of arithmetic expressions.

The program receives an input string of <n1 operation n2 operation n3>
n1, n2, n3 are integers from 0 to 9.
operation is addition, subtraction, multiplication or division.

For example, I pass the line 1 + 2 * 3 and expect to see 7 in the answer.

- We do not support brackets; operations are performed in the standard mathematical order.
- The interaction interface is not necessary. Tests are required. 
- Ready-made solutions and regular expressions cannot be used.
- Let's agree that it is impossible to divide by zero.
- There can be infinitely many numbers. Let our infinity end on the 100th member.
- There are no requirements for the accuracy of real numbers.
